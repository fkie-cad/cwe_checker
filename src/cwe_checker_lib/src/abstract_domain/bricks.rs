//! This module contains the BricksDomain and BrickDomain.
//!
//! The BricksDomain contains a sorted list of normalized BrickDomains.
//! It represents the composition of a string through sub sequences.
//! When a string is assigned to the BricksDomain, it is defined as a single sequence bricks
//! which occurs at least and at most one time which is represented by a min and max value in the
//! BrickDomain. e.g. "cwe" => \[\[{"cwe"}\]^{1,1}\]
//!
//! If two string are concatenated, their brick sequences are concatenated.
//! e.g. B1 = \[\[{"a"}\]^{1,1}\], B2 = \[\[{"b"}\]^{1,1}\] => B_new = \[\[{"a"}\]^{1,1}, \[{"b"}\]^{1,1}\]
//!
//! A set of strings can be built from multiple configurations of bricks
//! e.g. \[{"abc"}\]^{1,1} <=> \[{"a"}\]^{1,1}\[{"b"}\]^{1,1}\[{"c"}\]^{1,1}
//!
//! Introducing a normalized form \[T\]^{1,1} or \[T\]^{0, max>0}
//! will keep string representations unambiguous.
//!
//! Widening is applied for merges, so that the domains do not become too big.
//! Certain thresholds are defined which cause the domains to be widened if exceeded.
//! These thresholds are:
//!  - the *interval threshold* which overapproximates the number of times string sequences can occur in a brick.
//!  - the *sequence threshold* which  overapproximates the number of string sequences in a brick by forcing a *Top* value.
//!  - the *length threshold* which  overapproximates the number of bricks in the BricksDomain and forces a *Top* value.
