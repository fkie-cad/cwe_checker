//! This module implements a check for CWE-119: Buffer Overflow
//! and its variants CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read and CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write.
//!
//! Arrays or buffers of any kind are often accessed through indices.
//! If the index of an access is outside of the bounds of the buffer this can lead to severe consequences.
//! In the case of out-of-bounds read accesses this often leads to exposure of sensitive information to an attacker.
//! Out-of-bounds write accesses can often be used to hijack the control flow of a program
//! and thus may lead to arbitrary code execution.
//!
//! See <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html> for a detailed description.
//!
//! ## How the check works
//!
//! The check uses the results of the [Pointer Inference analysis](`crate::analysis::pointer_inference`)
//! to check whether any memory accesses may point outside of the bounds of the corresponding memory objects.
//! For this the results of the Pointer Inference analysis are aggregated interprocedurally.
//! Additionally, the check uses a lightweight intraprocedural dataflow fixpoint computation
//! to ensure that for each memory object only the first access outside of its bounds is flagged as a CWE.
//!
//! ## False Positives
//!
//! - Any analysis imprecision of the Pointer Inference analysis may lead to false positive results in this check.
//! - If no exact bounds for a memory object could be inferred then the strictest (smallest) bounds found are used,
//! which can lead to false positive warnings.
//!
//! ## False Negatives
//!
//! - In cases where the Pointer Inference analysis could not infer any bounds at all for the memory object or the access index
//! this check generally assumes analysis imprecision as the culprit and will not flag them as CWEs.
//! This leads to false negatives, especially in cases where the bounds directly depend on user input.
//! - The Pointer Inference analysis cannot distinguish different objects located on the same stack frame.
//! Thus buffer overflows on the stack can only be detected if they may reach outside of the whole stack frame.
//! This leads to false negatives, especially for buffer overflows caused by off-by-one bugs.
//! - For parameters of extern calls where a corresponding call stub is defined
//! the analysis approximates size parameters as small as possible, which can lead to false negatives.
//! Currently, analysis imprecision would lead to too many false positives if we would approximate by larger possible size parameters.
//! - For parameters of extern function calls without corresponding function stubs
//! the check only checks whether the parameter itself may point outside of the boundaries of a memory object.
//! But since we generally do not know what size the called function expects the pointed-to object to have
//! this still may miss buffer overflows occuring in the called function.
//! - Right now the check only considers buffers on the stack or the heap, but not buffers in global memory.
//! Thus corresponding overflows of buffers in global memory are not detected.
