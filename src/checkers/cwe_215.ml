(* TODO: IVG via gitter:
I see, so you need the CU information, and yes BAP doesn't provide this.
The right way to do this thing (a little bit complicated, but it
will preserve the abstractions), would be the following:

 - Define the abstract interface for the CU providers (you can use Source module
    or just define it manually with the interface you like)
 - Write plugins that will provide implementations
   (i.e., using readelf, objdump, IDA, LLVM, or whatever). The implementation shall
subscribe to Project.Info.file information stream and generate CU information every time a new file is open.

Of course, for the prototype your approach will work,
but in general case it is better to use the approach described above. *)
